## Introduction

Thank you for using QRGenerator ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.

**In short:** We don't collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal data. Everything happens locally on your device.

This policy applies to the QRGenerator iOS application available on the Apple App Store.

## Information We Collect

### We Don't Collect Any Personal Information

QRGenerator is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal information from our users.

**Specifically, we DO NOT:**

- ❌ Collect your name, email, or contact information
- ❌ Require account creation or login
- ❌ Track your usage or behavior
- ❌ Collect analytics or statistics
- ❌ Store your QR code data
- ❌ Transmit any data over the internet
- ❌ Use cookies or tracking technologies
- ❌ Share data with third parties
- ❌ Sell your data to anyone
- ❌ Use advertising networks or trackers

---

## How the App Works

QRGenerator operates entirely offline on your device:

### QR Code Generation

1. You enter information (URL, WiFi details, calendar events, etc.)
2. The App generates a QR code **locally on your device**
3. The QR code is displayed in the App
4. **No data is sent to our servers** (we don't even have servers!)

### Photo Library Access

The App requests permission to access your Photo Library **only when you choose to save a QR code**:

- **Purpose:** To save QR code images to your device's photo library
- **When:** Only when you tap "Save to Library" or similar action
- **Scope:** Write-only access (we only save images, we don't read existing photos)
- **Your Control:** You can deny this permission and still use the App (you just can't save QR codes to your library)

### Share Functionality

When you use the Share feature:
- iOS native share sheet is used
- You choose where to share (Messages, Email, AirDrop, etc.)
- Sharing happens directly from your device to your chosen destination
- We don't intercept, monitor, or access shared data

---

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

Any data you enter into the App (URLs, WiFi passwords, calendar events, etc.) may be temporarily stored in the App's local memory while you're using it. This data:

- ✅ Stays on your device
- ✅ Is never transmitted over the network
- ✅ Is automatically cleared when you close the App or generate a new QR code
- ✅ Is protected by iOS security (encrypted on device)

### No Cloud Storage

We do not use any cloud storage services. Your data never leaves your device.

### No Backups of App Data

The App does not back up your data to iCloud or any other service. If you uninstall the App, any temporary data is deleted.

---

## Third-Party Services

### We Don't Use Third-Party Analytics

Unlike many apps, we do not integrate:
- Google Analytics
- Facebook SDK
- Crash reporting services (that collect user data)
- Advertising networks
- Any other third-party tracking or analytics

### React Native Framework

The App is built using React Native, an open-source framework. React Native itself does not collect any user data on our behalf.

### iOS System Services

The App uses standard iOS system services:
- **Photo Library** (with your explicit permission)
- **Share Sheet** (standard iOS sharing)
- **Color Picker** (iOS UI component)

These are Apple's own services and are governed by Apple's privacy policy.

---

## Permissions

The App requests the following permissions:

### Photo Library Access (NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription)

**Purpose:** To save QR code images to your photo library

**Details:**
- Only requested when you choose to save a QR code
- Write-only access (we only add photos, we don't read your existing photos)
- You can deny this permission and still use all other features

- You can revoke access at any time

### No Other Permissions Required

The App does **not** request:
- ❌ Camera access

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do you collect any usage statistics?

**A:** No. We don't track how often you use the App, which features you use, or any other usage patterns.

### Q: Can you see the QR codes I create?

**A:** No. QR codes are generated entirely on your device. We never see them.

### Q: What happens to my WiFi passwords?

**A:** They stay on your device. When you create a WiFi QR code, the password is encoded into the QR image locally. It's never transmitted anywhere.

### Q: Why do you need photo library access?

**A:** Only to save QR code images to your photo library when you choose to save them. This is optional - you can still use the App without granting this permission.

### Q: Do you store my data for future app sessions?

**A:** No. The App doesn't remember your previous QR codes or settings between sessions. Each time you open the App, you start fresh.

### Q: Will this change in the future?

**A:** We're committed to privacy. If we ever need to collect any data in future updates (which is not currently planned), we will:
- Update this privacy policy with clear explanations
- Request your explicit consent
- Provide opt-out options
- Notify you in the app update notes

### Q: How can I verify you're telling the truth?

**A:** You can:
- Monitor network traffic using iOS network monitoring tools (you'll see zero external connections)
- Check app permissions in iOS Settings (you'll see we only request photo library)
- Use the app in airplane mode (works perfectly offline)
- Request a technical review of the app

### Q: What if I delete the app?

**A:** All temporary data stored locally is automatically deleted by iOS. Nothing remains on your device or anywhere else.
