## Recommendations

### For Next Session

2. **Verify Apple account immediately after** - May have wait time
3. **Don't start Xcode config until Apple account confirmed** - Avoid rework

### For Smooth Submission
1. **Test on multiple devices if possible** - Catch device-specific issues
2. **Use TestFlight internal testing** - Find bugs before public review
3. **Submit early in week** - Avoid weekend review delays
4. **Prepare marketing materials** - Launch announcement, social media, etc.

### For Long-Term Success
1. **Monitor user feedback** - Respond to reviews, iterate on feedback
2. **Plan version 1.1** - Additional QR types, scanning feature, etc.
3. **Track analytics** - Download numbers, user engagement
4. **Update regularly** - Bug fixes, iOS updates, feature additions
