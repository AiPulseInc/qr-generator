## Key Decisions Made

### 1. First-Time Publisher Focus
**Decision:** Write all documentation assuming zero prior iOS publishing experience
**Rationale:** User indicated they are first-time publisher; comprehensive guidance prevents frustration and mistakes

### 2. Complete Coverage Approach
**Decision:** Create 5 separate focused documents rather than one large file
**Rationale:**
- Easier to navigate specific topics
- Can be used as reference materials independently
- Reduces cognitive load
- Allows for focused updates

### 3. Interactive Checklist Format
**Decision:** Make assets checklist editable with status tracking
**Rationale:** Provides tangible progress tracking and prevents missed steps

### 4. Privacy-First Messaging
**Decision:** Emphasize no data collection in all public-facing content
**Rationale:**
- Aligns with app's actual implementation
- Strong selling point in privacy-conscious market
- Simplifies privacy policy and App Store compliance

### 5. Professional Tone Throughout
**Decision:** Maintain professional, educational tone (no emojis, casual language)
**Rationale:** Documentation serves as formal reference material and reflects app quality

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Structured Approach:** Creating 5 focused documents rather than one monolithic file made content more accessible
2. **Interactive Elements:** Checklist format provides tangible progress tracking
3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** No guesswork needed for next steps
4. **Clear Prioritization:** NEXT_SESSION.md provides obvious starting point

### What Could Be Improved
